## Data Set
It's a **combination** of related data. It can contain numerical (`numbers in any format / unlimited sets`) and categorical (`names / limited sets`) inputs. It can be represented as a table. Example:

| Beer(Liters) | Bread | Cheese(Kilograms) |
| ------------ | ----- | ----------------- |
| 2 | Ciabatta | 3 |
| 3 | Panini | 5 |

The previous data set contains three different inputs; Beer (`numerical`), Bread (`categorical`) and Cheese (`numerical`).

A Data Set is created from a source (`CSV` or `Parquet` files) to be handled by Aleph.

## How does Aleph handle a Data Set?
  
In order to generate **information**, Aleph uses different algorithm to process a Data Set. Processing a Data Set can result in different types of output, from new Data Sets to other types of resources.
