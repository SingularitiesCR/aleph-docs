According to the **learning hierarchy**, the data is only the base of the process; this data generates **information**, which is used to generate **knowledge**. Once an user has knowledge, it's capable to take decisions, that is called **wisdom**.

  <h3>What is an information set?</h3>
  <p>A collection of <strong>relevant information</strong>, useful for a better understanding of the data and capable to offer <strong>knowledge</strong> to the user through its operations.  <a href="/information-sets/what-is-an-information-set">Read more...</a>.</p>

## How is an Information Set created?

An **Information Set** is created after multiple algorithms are applied to a **Data Set**. A Data Set should go through the following stages to create an Information Set:
1. **Rule mining**: The Data Set is mined with classification or market basket algorithms.
2. **Rule Analysis**: The rules are processed by the **Aleph Reasoner**.
3. **Information Set Created**: An information Set is created as a collection of **Belief Systems**.
