	<li>Easy way to comprehend your data behavior like relationships across your products.</li>
  <li>You can query your data with using custom surveys to quickly access key features.</li>
  <li>Ability to learn or forget some key aspect of the data to show alternative behavior.</li>
  <li>A nicer way to see a row dataset with the power of machine learning.</li>

## Belief System
  
Is the collection of All the modal states related to a particular entity. An Entity can be a person, a company, a cluster of a particular entities. 

## Modal State
  
A Modal State is a possible world that represents your data in a consistent state according with the behavior obtain in the Machine Learning process

## Representation

An information set can be represented in various ways. Example, since an Information Set holds constrains referring to a Data Set and contains these constrains as Belief States, each state can be seen as a stack column with a set of conditionals linked to it.
