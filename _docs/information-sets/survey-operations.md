## Example

Let's use the following Information set as example for all Operations:
This Information set has only one Belief Systems. The Belief System has the following 8 States.

![](/images/infoset-example-survey.png)

## Believes
  
Return if the observation is True within the knowledge in all of the Belief States in the Belief System

#### YAML
```yaml
- type: believes
  expression: "nachos : {1} int32"
```

#### Real World Example
```text
Do you believe that nachos is equal to 1?
```

With the [example](./survey-operations#section-example) 

#### Output
```text
Yes
```

## Contradicts
  
Return if the observation is Flase within the knowledge in all of the Belief States in the Belief System

#### YAML
```yaml
- type: believes
  expression: "not nachos : {1} int32"
```

#### Real World Example
```text
Do you believes that nachos is not equal to 1?
```

With the [example](./survey-operations#section-example) 

#### Output
```text
Yes
```

## Diagnose
  
A logical explanation of why each of the states of your information set can't accept the expression
If your expression is accepted an empty set will be returned

#### YAML
```yaml
- type: diagnose
  observation: 'weekday: {"Weekstart"} weekdays and burgers : {2} int32'
  number_of_conditionals: 100
  time_reference: 1458157872963 #Wed Mar 16 2016 13:51:12 GMT-0600 (CST)
```

#### Real life example
```text
What contradicts the possibility of Day been Monday and Taco equals 1?
```

With the [example](./survey-operations#section-example) 

#### Output
```text
Because weekday is Weekend and burgers is 1 in States 0, 3, 4, 5
Because burgers is 1 in States 1, 6, 7
Because weekday is Midweek in State 2
```

## Explanation
  
The logical set of rules that create each of the states of the Information Set.
A rule will explain 1 or more states.

#### YAML
```yaml
- type: explanation
```

With the [example](./survey-operations#section-example) 

#### Output
```text
State 0 is defined by:\n  If chicken is 1 then daytime is Dawning 
  If nachos is 1 then daytime is Dawning
...
State 3 is defined by:
  If burger is 1 and weekday is Weekend then daytime is Dawning  
  If nachos is 1 then daytime is Dawining
```

## Get Value
  
Retrieve the value of the Key. If there isn't a consistency within the States null is returned

#### YAML
```yaml
- type: get_value
  key: chicken
```

#### Real World Example
```text
What's the value of chicken?
```

With the [example](./survey-operations#section-example) 

#### Output
```text
Chicken is equal to One
```

## Hypotesis
  
Returns if the each of the belief systems will  [Believes](doc:survey-operations#section-believes) a hypothesis after be Revised by the assumption. 

#### YAML
```yaml
- type: hypothesis
  assumption: "nachos : {1} int32"
  hypothesis: "chicken : {1} int32"
  number_of_conditionals: 100
  search_stabilization_percent: 0.0
  time_reference: 1458157872963
```

#### Real World Example
```text
Will nachos equal 1 be belive if tacos been 1 is added to the System?
```

With the [example](./survey-operations#section-example) 

#### Output
```text
True
```

## Is consistent
  
Return if the expression is True in at least one Belief State

#### YAML
```yaml
- type: is_consistent
  expression: "nachos : {1} int32"
```

#### Real World Example
```text
Is nachos equal to 1 possible in any of the possible worlds?
```

With the [example](./survey-operations#section-example) 


#### Output
```text
Yes
```

## Is probable
  
Return if the position of the Key equal Value is greater than half.

#### YAML
```yaml
- type: is_probable
  key: burgers
  value: "{1} int32"
```

#### Real World Example
```text
Is probable that Burgers is 1?
```

With the [example](./survey-operations#section-example) 

#### Output
```text
Yes
```

## Mentions

List all keys with all its possible values and its positions 
Optional you could specify a key

#### YAML
```yaml
# for all keys
- type: mentions
# only for chicken
- type: mentions
  key: chicken
```

#### Real World Example
```text
What are the values of all the keys?
or
What are the values of the Chicken?
```

With the [example](./survey-operations#section-example) 

#### Output
```text
Mentions of all keys:
  0.778 Nachos: 1 
    
  0.222 Weekday: Weekend
  0.444 Weekday: Weekstart
  0.333 Weekday: Midweek

- type: multiple_choice
  key: burgers

    - "{1} int32"
    - "{3} int32"
    - "{5} int32"
```
